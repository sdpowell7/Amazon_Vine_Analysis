##### ***Amazon Shoes Review***
******************

## ***Overview***

In this project I looked at Amazon reviews of shoes. Specifically I was analyzing the reviews made by Amazon Vine members and non-Vine members. Amazon Vine members are provided products from companies like SellBy. Those Vine members are then required to publish reviews. I wanted to know if there was a significant difference between the paid and unpaid reviews of shoes. Before doing my analysis I was of the thinking that paid reviews made up most of the reviews. Especially the 5 star reviews. I was wrong, at least for shoe reviews that is. 

## ***Results***

I was surprised to see the results. There were actually 4,366,916 reviews. I filtered out reviews that more that 20 votes and that more that 50% of the votes said the review was helpful. That left me with 25,136 helpful votes. To my surprise, only 20 of those votes were paid reviews. There were 25,116 unpaid reviews.

Of those total helpful votes 13,491 left 5 star ratings. Of the 20 paid reviews, 12 were 5 star ratings. Of the 25,136 unpaid reviews 13,479 were 5 star reviews.

When I broke the 5 star reviews to percentages, it confirmed the difference. Vine paid reviews made up .08% of the total 5 star reviews. Unpaid reviews however made up 99.92%

## ***Summary***

The reviews for shoes surprised me. I had anticipated paid reviews to make up more of the reviews, especially 5 star reviews. I would like to compare it to other products though. My hypothesis is that shoes aren't a product that customers join Vine for. That is why I think the unpaid reviews for shoes is so high. I think household items or electronics would have less of a drastric difference between paid and unpaid reviews. But again, that is just a hypothesis without definate proof. I would need to analyze and compare different types of product reviews to support my hypothesis.
